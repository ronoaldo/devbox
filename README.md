# Development Box

This repository is a collection of scripts
to automate the deployment of development tools
that I frequently use on several Cloud infrastructure.

## Custom Nitrous PRO Container

Nitrous PRO is a cloud based workspace.
In Nitrous, you work on a dedicated VM
that run the IDE on a Docker container.

This custom template installs several tools
that I use to work on several projects.

## Codebox at Google Cloud

This is a work in progress set of scripts to launch
a Google Compute Engine VM with several tools,
including a web-based IDE using Codebox.

The idea is to allow you to spin up your own VM,
with a set of nice features and with the flexibility
of configuration options that we have at Google Cloud.

Please use at your own risk.
